# R1 Notes on Mahler's Symphony 5

This is a personal notes trying to provide a more structured understanding of Mahler's Symphony 5, one of my favorite symphonies.

Herbert von Karajan once said that when you hear Mahler’s Fifth:

> “*you forget that time has passed. A great performance of the Fifth is a transforming experience. The fantastic finale almost forces you to hold your breath*.”

After conducting its premiere, Mahler is reported to have said: ‘Nobody understood it. I wish I could conduct the first performance fifty years after my death.’

According to Naxos, Symphony No.5 is the most recorded of all Mahler’s symphonies.


## Background

#### Personal Experience

The Symphony No.5 emerged during a period of personal change for Mahler. He'd been enjoying great success as conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic but was forced to resign in 1901 after falling seriously ill. Towards the end of the year his fortunes changed again when he met Alma Schindler, an intelligent, artistic young woman whom he married in 1902.

Perhaps it was this unexpected brush with mortality, juxtaposed with the discovery of true love, that gave such poignancy to the Adagietto. Searching for a piece of music that would echo similar events on screen, Visconti not only used Mahler's music, but also took the liberty of turning Death in Venice's main character Gustav Von Aschenbach from being a writer to a composer.

#### Artistic Point of View

The lone trumpet call that opens this symphony launches a whole new chapter in Mahler’s music. Gone is the picturesque world of the first four symphonies—music inspired by folk tales and song, music that calls on the human voice and is explained by the written word. With the Fifth Symphony, as Bruno Walter put it, Mahler “**is now aiming to write music as a musician.**” 

#### Further Analysis

* In fact, the break in Mahler’s compositional style is neither as clean nor as radical as we might at first think. 
  *  The trumpet call that opens this symphony is a quotation from the climax of the first movement of the Fourth Symphony.
* For Donald Mitchell, perhaps the most important Mahler scholar writing today, the Fifth Symphony “**initiates a new concept of an interior drama.”** The idea of a programmatic symphony has not vanished, **“it has gone underground, rather, or inside.”**







## Structure

As in the later Seventh Symphony and the projected Tenth, the Fifth Symphony is divided into five movements. But more important are the numbers defining three basic parts, with the weighty scherzo standing alone in the middle. 

Part 1 views life as tragedy, moving from the bleak funeral march of the first movement to the deflated climax of the second. The third part approaches, and ultimately achieves, triumph. Part 2, the lively scherzo, is the hinge upon which the music shifts.

### I: *Trauermarsch* (Funeral March)

* The first movement begins with funeral music, featuring the summons of the single trumpet. This leads to a mournful melody offered initially by first violins and cellos, then taken over by the woodwind.

Mahler had written funeral marches before—the first three symphonies all include them—but this is a new kind of funeral music: tough as nails, lean, scrubbed clean of simple pictorial touches. <u>It is a much more concise movement than the tremendous march that opens the Resurrection Symphony.</u> 

* Here the march gives way to a defiant trio—a terrible outburst of grief; 
* then the cortège returns, followed by the trio, now dragged down to the march’s slow, lumbering pace. 
* Near the end there is a new idea, full of yearning—a rising minor ninth falling to the octave—that will find fulfillment in the second movement, just as that movement will echo things already developed here. 
* The trumpet calls the first movement to a close, in utter desolation.




### II: *Stürmisch bewegt, mit größter Vehemenz* (Moving stormily, with the greatest vehemence).

The second movement is both a companion to and a commentary on the first. It is predominately angry and savage music, with periodic lapses into the quieter, despairing music we have left behind. 

* There is one jarring moment, so characteristic of Mahler, when all the grief and anger spills over into sheergiddiness—a momentary indiscretion, like laughter at the graveside. 
* The music quickly regains its composure, but seems even more disturbed. 
* Near the end, the trumpets and trombones begin a noble brass chorale, brave and affirmative. For a moment it soars. And then, suddenly, almost inexplicably, it loses steam, falters, and falls flat. It is one of Mahler’s cruelest jokes.



The turbulent second movement is closely linked thematically to the first. It is marked by a repeated motif in the cellos and double basses, interrupted by the cry of the woodwind. 

The <u>cellos introduce a second melody</u> which develops before being fragmented by references to the first, and finally culminating in a stormy outburst which then dwindles to nothing.



### III: *Scherzo*

>  “a human being in the full light of day, in the prime of his life". 

The third movement, the *Scherzo*, is the longest and acts as the centre to the whole symphony. Broadly it includes two trio sections, followed by a final coda. It is striking in its contrast to what has gone before it – being more cheerful and optimistic than the previous two movements.



The great central scherzo caused problems at the first rehearsal. From Cologne Mahler wrote to Alma: 

> The scherzo is the very devil of a movement. I see it is in for a peck of troubles! Conductors for the next fifty years will all take it too fast and make nonsense of it; and the public—oh, heavens, what are they to make of this chaos of which new worlds are forever being engendered? 

It is hard to know just how fast Mahler felt this music should go—it is marked “vigorously, not too fast”— and today his peculiar mixture of ländler (a nice country dance) and waltz (more upscale) seems neither chaotic nor nonsensical, although it is still provocative. 

The whole is an ebullient dance of life, with moments of simple nostalgia, and, when the horns seem to call across mountain valleys, an almost childlike wonder. 



### IV: *Adagio*
The famous Adagietto is, if we believe Willem Mengelberg’s assertion, Gustav Mahler's declaration of his love for Alma, presented to his wife without a word of explanation. 

The much-loved Adagietto is really the introduction to the finale, incomplete on its own, not so much musically as psychologically. Ironically, for many years this was one of the few Mahler excerpts ever played at concerts; it was later borrowed, carelessly, as movie music for Death in Venice, and won still more new converts. Here Mahler finds a fresh kind of lyricism which he gives not to the winds, which so often sang in the earlier symphonies, but to the strings alone, <u>over the gentle, hesitant, almost improvisatory strumming of the harp.</u>





### V:  *Rondo-Finale*

> The Guardian has labelled the Rondo-Finale as ‘the finale to end all finales’.

The Rondo-Finale follows on immediately from the Adagietto that has gone before, although much more lively than the previous movement. It utilises themes heard elsewhere in the symphony, including those from the Adagietto and the chorale that ends the second movement. It has been noted that this is the last symphonic movement Mahler wrote where there is unalloyed joy – later symphonies are unavoidably linked with the heartbreak that overcame Mahler’s life.

A single note from the horn—so fresh and unexpected, with the sound of strings still in our ears—calls us back to earth. The finale begins at once with the suggestion of one of the Wunderhorn melodies, and then changes direction. This is radiant music, so infectious that part of the Adagietto even turns up, virtually unrecognizable in these up-tempo surroundings. Mahler’s Fifth is his Eroica, moving from tragedy to triumph, and his triumph could not be more sweeping. Ultimately, the same brass chorale that fell to defeat in the second movement enters and carries the finale to a proper, rollicking conclusion. 

**Note:**

Finally, a word about Mahler’s choice of key. The Fifth Symphony begins in C-sharp minor and ends five movements later in D major. Until Mahler’s time, it was customary to begin and end in the same key (or to finish in the relative major if the piece started in the minor), and some of Mahler’s symphonies do that. But many do not, and this kind of progressive tonality, as it is often called, is an essential part of his musical language, an example of how he helped to stretch the boundaries and the meaning of tonality. In the Fifth Symphony, it underlines the “inner drama” of the music: <u>the struggle to rise from C-sharp to D, and from minor to major, underlines the music’s quest to rise from tragedy to victory.</u>
