“The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling”





[TOC]





## Work Deeply 

“What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.”

### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

Donald Knuth:

* “As I’ll detail in the next section, Knuth deploys a form of monasticism that prioritizes deep work by trying to eliminate or minimize all other types of work. ”

> “I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.”

Stephenson:

> “The productivity equation is a non-linear one, in other words. This accounts for why I am a bad correspondent and why I very rarely accept speaking engagements. If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops spectacularly.

* Monastic philosophy does not works for everyone:

  “If you’re outside this pool, its radical simplicity shouldn’t evince too much envy. On the other hand, if you’re inside this pool—someone whose contribution to the world is discrete, clear, and individualized”

### The Bimodal Philosophy

* “The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur.”

* “This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. **To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.**”

* “As Jung, Grant, and Perlow’s subjects discovered, people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible <u>if these periods are well defined and well advertised</u>, and outside these stretches, you’re once again easy to find.”

  



### The Rhythmic Philosophy

**“ By supporting deep work with <u>rock-solid routines</u> that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.”**

#### The Chain Model

* Your only mission is not to break the chain.
  * “ This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. ”

**Chunked Time(not regular)**

* “Not surprisingly, this strategy didn’t yield much productivity. In a dissertation boot camp Chappell had attended the year before, he’d managed to produce a full thesis chapter in a single week of rigorous deep work. After he accepted his full-time job, he managed to produce only a single additional chapter in the entire first year he was working.”

**Rhythmic Chunked Time**

“It was the glacial writing progress during this year that drove Chappell to embrace the rhythmic method. He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his dissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early progress, he soon pushed his wake-up time to four forty-five to squeeze out even more morning depth.”



* “When I interviewed Chappell for this book, he described his rhythmic approach to deep work scheduling as “both astronomically productive and guilt free.” His routine was producing four to five pages of academic prose per day and was capable of generating drafts of thesis chapters at a rate of one chapter every two or three weeks: a phenomenal output for someone who also worked a nine-to-five job. “Who’s to say that I can’t be that prolific?” he concluded. “Why not me?”

  

### The Journalistic Philosophy

**Issacson Walter**

> “It was always amazing… he could retreat up to the bedroom for a while, when the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to work on his book… he’d go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we’d hear the typewriter pounding, then he’d come down as relaxed as the rest of us… the work never seemed to faze him, he just happily went up to work when he had the spare time.
> ”

* “Isaacson was methodic: <u>Any time he could find some free time, he would switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book.</u> This is how, it turns out, one can write a nine-hundred-page book on the side while spending the bulk of one’s day becoming one of the country’s best magazine writers.”

* “Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. 
* This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities—a conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed. ”

### Ritualize

**Pulitzer Prize–winning biographer Robert Caro**

“Where he places his books, how he stacks his notebooks, what he puts on his wall, even what he wears to the office: Everything is specified by a routine that has varied little over Caro’s long career. “I trained myself to be organized,” he explained.”

> “[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.”
>

“To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. ”

* “Great minds like Caro and Darwin didn’t deploy rituals to be weird; they did so because success in their work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again—there’s no way to win a Pulitzer Prize or conceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limit. ”



#### The keys for ritualization:

* Where you are working and how long will you be working.
* How you will work once you started working.
  * “ Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any Internet use, or <u>maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. ”</u>
  * “Without this structure, you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard. <u>These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.</u>

* “ How you’ll support your work. 
  * Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. 
  * For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear. (As Nietzsche said: “It is only ideas gained from walking that have any worth.”) 
  * This support might also include environmental factors, such as organizing the raw materials of your work to minimize energy-dissipating friction (as we saw with Caro’s example). 
  * To maximize your success, you need to support your efforts to go deep. 
  * At the same time, this support needs to be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment.

## Make Grand Gestures

**J.K Rowling** 

“Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture. ”

“By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.”

“<u>In all of these examples, it’s not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand. To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room until you complete an important invention</u>: These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.”

### Don't work alone

#### The theory of serendipitous creativity

**MIT building 20**

“Around the same time that Building 20 was hastily constructed, a more systematic pursuit of serendipitous creativity was under way two hundred miles to the southwest in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was here that Bell Labs director Mervin Kelly guided the construction of a new home for the lab that would purposefully encourage interaction between its diverse mix of scientists and engineers. ”

“ As Bell Labs chronicler Jon Gertner notes about this design: “Traveling the hall’s length without encountering a number of acquaintances, problems, diversions and ideas was almost impossible. A physicist on his way to lunch in the cafeteria was like a magnet rolling past iron filings.”
This strategy, mixed with Kelly’s aggressive recruitment of some of the world’s best minds, yielded some of the most concentrated innovation in the history of modern civilization. <u>In the decades following the Second World War, the lab produced, among other achievements: the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cellular communication system, and fiber optic networking.</u> At the same time, <u>their theorists formulated both information theory and coding theory, their astronomers won the Nobel Prize for empirically validating the Big Bang Theory, and perhaps most important of all, their physicists invented the transistor.</u>

**What make innovations possible?**

“But it’s here that we must embrace more nuance in understanding what really generated innovation in sites such as Building 20 and Bell Labs.”

“This combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields a hub-and-spoke architecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported”

“It’s a setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.””

“Their creative mojo had more to do with the fact that these offices shared a small number of long connecting spaces—forcing researchers to interact whenever they needed to travel from one location to another. These mega-hallways, in other words, provided highly effective hubs.”

#### Academic deep work circle

* “Brattain and Bardeen worked together during this period in a small lab, often side by side, pushing each other toward better and more effective designs. These efforts consisted primarily of deep work—but a type of deep work we haven’t yet encountered. B<u>rattain would concentrate intensely to engineer an experimental design that could exploit Bardeen’s latest theoretical insight; then Bardeen would concentrate intensely to make sense of what Brattain’s latest experiments revealed, trying to expand his theoretical framework to match the observations. This back-and-forth represents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what I call the whiteboard effect. ”</u>

#### Guidelines

* **Distraction remains a destroyer of depth.** Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals.
* “By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.”



## Execute Like a Business

D1 

* “As the authors of The 4 Disciplines of Execution explain, “The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of “wildly important goals.” This simplicity will help focus an organization’s energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.”





## Quit social media

the most connected man in the world



* The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate. 
  * Willpower is limited, and therefore the more enticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it’ll be to maintain focus on something important. To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.

* It is quite easy to slide back into into the fragmented state where we began.
* Threshold



* This is a nice diversion, but hardly something central to his or her sense of social connection or happiness.



**The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:** You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify *any* possible benefit to its use, or *anything* you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.



The problem with this approach, of course, is that it ignores all the negatives that come along with the tools in question. These services are engineered to be addictive—robbing time and attention from activities that more directly support your professional and personal goals (such as deep work). Eventually, if you use these tools enough, you’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, hyperdistracted connectivity that plagued Baratunde Thurston and millions of others like him. It’s here that we encounter the true insidious nature of an any-benefit mind-set. The use of network tools can be harmful. If you don’t attempt to weigh pros against cons, but instead use any glimpse of some potential benefit as justification for unrestrained use of a tool, then you’re unwittingly crippling your ability to succeed in the world of knowledge work.



### Tool selection 

 *Craftsman approach* to tool selection, a name that emphasizes that tools are ultimately aids to the larger goals of one’s craft.

**The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:** Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.



### Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits

The goal of this strategy, therefore, is to offer some structure to this thought process—a way to reduce some of the complexity of deciding which tools really matter to you.

#### Identifying your priorities

The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life. 

* "I pursue two important goals, one centered on being an effective teacher in the classroom and effective mentor to my graduate students, and another centered on being an effective researcher. "

Once you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal.

The next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you currently use.

* For each such tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a *substantially positive impact*, a *substantially negative impact*, or *little impact* on your regular and successful participation in the activity. 

Example:
<u>Professional Goal:</u> To craft well-written, narrative-driven stories that change the way people understand the world.
<u>Key Activities Supporting This Goal:</u>• Research patiently and deeply.• Write carefully and with purpose.



**The Law of the Vital Few**[*](opeb://187ce14e5d0a0a93e276565a28dd34a3/epubbook.xhtml#footnotes.xhtmlfn0013fn)**:** <u>In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.</u>

* What’s key to understand here, however, is that this radical reduction of priorities is not arbitrary, but is instead motivated by an idea that has arisen repeatedly in any number of different fields, from client profitability to social equality to prevention of crashes in computer programs.

It’s a zero-sum game. And because your time returns substantially more rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit.

### Quit Social Media

“Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party, right?”

!!! Once the packing was done, Nicodemus then spent the next week going through his normal routine. If he needed something that was packed, he would unpack it and put it back where it used to go. At the end of the week, he noticed that the vast majority of his stuff remained untouched in its boxes.

Similar routines for social media:

* If someone reaches out to you by other means and asks why your activity on a particular service has fallen off, you can explain, but don’t go out of your way to tell people.

* Thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation

  * Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?

  * Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?

They offer personalized information arriving on an unpredictable intermittent schedule—making them massively addictive and therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and succeed with any act of concentration.

Note that:

* Convincing our culture that if you don’t use their products you might *miss out*.
* This fear that you might miss out has obvious parallels to Nicodemus’s fear that the voluminous stuff in his closets might one day prove useful, which is why I’m suggesting a corrective strategy that parallels his packing party. 
* **They’re not really all that important in your life.**
* The delusion that  binds them to social media is the idea that people *want to hear what you have to say*, and that they might be disappointed if you suddenly leave them bereft of your commentary.
* A shallow collectivist alternative: *I’ll pay attention to what you say if you pay attention to what I say—regardless of its value.*
* By dropping off these services without notice you can test the reality of your status as a content producer. *

They can be fun, but in the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish, they’re a lightweight whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper. 



### Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Accordingly, the typical man should instead use this time as an aristocrat would: to perform rigorous self-improvement—a task that, according to Bennett, involves, primarily, reading great literature and poetry.

As I argued in Rule #2, however, such behavior is dangerous, as it weakens your mind’s general ability to resist distraction, making deep work difficult later when you really want to concentrate. To make matters worse, these network tools are not something you join and therefore they’re not something you can remove from your life by quitting (rendering the previous two strategies irrelevant). They’re always available, just a quick click away.

*Put more thought into your leisure time*.

Structured hobbies provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate specific actions with specific goals to fill your time. A set program of reading, à la Bennett, where you spend regular time each night making progress on a series of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as is, of course, exercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.

> *What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.*

 Not only will this preserve your ability to resist distraction and concentrate, but you might even fulfill Arnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of experiencing, perhaps for the first time, what it means to live, and not just exist.





我对于自己的界定越来越偏向于一个content producer，

高质量的信息和讨论，其实都是 rubbish 如何取得高质量的信息？

but it’s important to discuss because this quest for self-importance plays an important role in convincing people to continue to thoughtlessly fragment their time and attention.
